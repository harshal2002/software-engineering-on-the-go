## Computer Science for Everyone

I have been in Software engineer for almost 6+ years now. Having hands-on experience on multiple programming languages, databases (SQL and NoSQL), servers, and few others that change over the period of time. So you can assume of _**Jack of all trades but master of none**_.While I know about programming and how software can scale, there is always a common problem that every software engineer feels within that is **the imposter syndrome**. 

I have been going throught the same feelings and while these one of the common things in tech always keep yourself motivate and keep learning new things. So, I have decided to create a roadmap for all those who feels just like me and have been going though same phase of their career.

I don't know how this repository will grow over the period of time but I will keep adding resources and my personal learing on how anyone can make their career in Software Engineering.

       If someone wanted to build a website, for example, they might hire a front-end developer to create the site's layout. The front-end developer determines where to place images, what the navigation should look like, and how to present the site. Much of their work involves ensuring the appearance and layout of the site or application is easy to navigate and intuitive for the user.

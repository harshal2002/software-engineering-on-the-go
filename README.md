## Computer Science for Everyone

I have been in Software engineer for almost 6+ years now. Having hands-on experience on multiple programming languages, databases (SQL and NoSQL), servers, and few others that change over the period of time. So you can assume of _**Jack of all trades but master of none**_.While I know about programming and how software can scale, there is always a common problem that every software engineer feels within that is **the imposter syndrome**. 

I have been going throught the same feelings and while these one of the common things in tech always keep yourself motivate and keep learning new things. So, I have decided to create a roadmap for all those who feels just like me and have been going though same phase of their career.

I don't know how this repository will grow over the period of time but I will keep adding resources and my personal learing on how anyone can make their career in Software Engineering. 

I recommend going through this amazing github reposistory by @jwasham : [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)
